The woods can be very dangerous.\r\nCartman\r\nOkay, Mom.\r\nKyle\r\nReady to go hunting, Cartman?\r\nStan\r\nYeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?\r\nJimbo\r\nThat\'s right, Stanley. Animals are much easier to shoot in the morning.\r\nLiane\r\nHere hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts.\r\nJimbo\r\nDon\'t worry Mrs. Cartman, we\'ll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe.\r\nNed Gerblansky\r\nHello, Mrs. Cartman. How are you today?\r\nLiane\r\nBe sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don\'t wipe with poison ivy.\r\nThe other boys laugh.\r\nCartman\r\nDude, that\'s sick mom.\r\nLiane\r\nAnd I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy\'s not far away.\r\nThey laugh some more.\r\nCartman\r\nDrive, Drive!\r\nLiane\r\nYou give your mommy a kissy.\r\nCartman\r\nDrive the car damn-it, drive!\r\nIn the Humvee.\r\nKyle\r\n[In a slight falsetto.] Don\'t get scared up in the mountains Cartman.\r\nCartman\r\nShut up, I\'m not scared of nothing.\r\nStan\r\nMaybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.\r\nKenny\r\n(Maybe she\'ll suck my dick.)\r\nJimbo\r\nOh, ho, that\'s disgusting.\r\nCartman\r\nYou piece of crap, I\'ll kill you!\r\nCartman starts fighting with Kenny.\r\nJimbo\r\nThat\'s the spirit boys, let\'s get that testosterone flowin\'.\r\nCartman\r\nEeeeenh!\r\nHe is about to strike Kenny again.\r\nJimbo\r\nNow boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don\'t ever walk with your gun unless the safety\'s on. Second, don\'t shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber.\r\nStan\r\nUh, Uncle Jimbo, we don\'t drink beer.\r\nJimbo\r\nYou what?!?\r\nNed\r\nmmmMoh Yeah, that\'s right, I don\'t think eight year old kids drink beer, mmm.\r\nKyle\r\nI like chocolate milk.\r\nJimbo\r\nWell, we\'ll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like ...fishing ...sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization.\r\nJimbo drives the Humvee up a small mountain very close to town.\r\nOn the mountain.\r\nJimbo\r\nWelp, here we are. Okay, each of you young \'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes.\r\nCartman\r\nHey, I didn\'t get a gun.\r\nJimbo hands him one.\r\nCartman\r\nSweet. This is like the gun I used in \'Nam\r\nStan\r\nYou weren\'t in Vietnam, Cartman.\r\nNed\r\nWere you stationed in Da Nang?\r\nStan\r\nCartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can\'t believe anything he says.\r\nCartman\r\nHey, I\'ll blow your friggin\' head off.\r\nThey point their guns at each other, Jimbo rushes up.\r\nJimbo\r\nHey, look out son, that\'s dangerous. You\'re gonna spill your beer.\r\nStan\r\nMy Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he\'s gonna take me hunting in Africa.\r\nKyle\r\nWow, that\'d be cool.\r\nCartman\r\nMy mom says there\'s a lot of black people in Africa.\r\nJimbo\r\nBoys, looky there. That there\'s a Rocky Mountain black bear ...one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn\'t it beautiful... By God, it\'s coming right for us!\r\nShoots it. It is hit and flips off the mound it was on.\r\nStan\r\nHey, it wasn\'t coming right for us. It was just sitting there.\r\nJimbo\r\nShhh, not so loud. Now that there\'s just a technicality.\r\nKyle\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\nJimbo\r\nYou see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.\r\nCartman\r\nDemocrats piss me off!\r\nJimbo\r\nThey say we can\'t shoot certain animals anymore, unless they\'re posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin\', we have to say \'It\'s coming right for us.\'\r\nStan\r\nWow, you\'re smart Uncle Jimbo.\r\nNed\r\nMmm, Jimbo look, mm.\r\nJimbo\r\nOhho, it\'s a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It\'s coming right for us!\r\nJimbo pulls out a bazooka, mounts it on his shoulder, and fires a rocket. All that\'s left of the deer is a hind leg, which falls over.\r\nCartman\r\nKickass!!\r\nEveryone is in creep position now, except Jimbo.\r\nJimbo\r\nDid you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck.\r\nNed\r\nMoohh, rabbit, rabbit, 5 o\'clock.\r\nA rabbit hops blissfully into view.\r\nJimbo\r\n[Drops to the ground.] Let\'s move, moove!\r\nHe hustles off to the right. Ned follows.\r\nStan\r\nIs this hunting?\r\nKyle\r\nI guess so.\r\nCartman\r\nAh, dude! I\'m starting to have flashbacks.\r\nKyle\r\nWhat?!\r\nCartman\r\nDanforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!\r\nOn the ridge.\r\nJimbo\r\nThis one\'s yours Stan.\r\nStan aims at the bunny, but it just blinks at him. Jimbo coaxes.\r\nJimbo\r\n[Calmly.]It\'s coming right for us.\r\nNed\r\nIt\'s coming right for us.\r\nStan focuses. The bunny blinks.\r\nKyle\r\nShoot it Stan.\r\nCartman\r\nI got your back, soldier.\r\nStan lowers his gun.\r\nStan\r\nI can\'t.\r\nThe bunny hops away.\r\nJimbo\r\nWhat the? What\'s wrong with you?\r\nStan\r\nI don\'t wanna shoot the bunny.\r\nJimbo\r\nWhat the hell are you talking about, \'you don\'t wanna shoot the bunny?\' You\'re babbling, you\'re not making any sense, you\'re hysterical.\r\nStan\r\nI\'m not hysterical, I just don\'t want to shoot the bunny.\r\nJimbo\r\nNo nephew of mine is gonna be a tree-hugger.\r\nCartman\r\nYeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can\'t shoot anything.\r\nStan\r\nI can shoot you, fat ass!\r\nCartman\r\nI can shoot you too!\r\nStan\r\nI\'ll kill you!\r\nCartman\r\nI\'ll fill you full of lead!\r\nThe mountain rumbles.\r\nKyle\r\nHey, what\'s that?\r\nSouth Park Center for Seismic Activity, Randy is humming: another day and all is quiet. A rumble is heard in the distance, but Randy is dozing off. A stronger rumble rolls through.\r\nRandy checks the seismograph.\r\nRandy Marsh\r\nWhat the heck is this?\r\nHe places a call.\r\nRandy\r\nYeah, Frank, it\'s uh Randy, Uh huh, good, Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle\'s moving. Yeah, it\'s going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? ...Uh huh ...Uh huh ...Let me check.\r\nHe looks out the window at the volcano, which shows a column of steam.\r\nRandy\r\nYeah, it\'s smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano!\r\nDramatic music builds, then Randy...sips his coffee.\r\nNight on the mountain.\r\nCartman\r\nMy weenies won\'t cook.\r\nNed\r\nMmm, this wood won\'t burn, umm.\r\nJimbo\r\nWell, Ned, looks like we\'ll have to use the old Indian fire trick.\r\nNed\r\nMmm, yepper.\r\nNed pours gasoline on the fire. The flames run up the stream and set Ned aflame.\r\nNed\r\nMmm, aahh, oh.\r\nJimbo\r\nHehehaahaa, hey, stop-drop-and roll Ned. Haaahaaaaahaha!!\r\nNed drops and rolls. He knocks the gas can over, and the flaming gas blows up the Hummer.\r\nStan, Kyle\r\nWhoa!\r\nJimbo\r\nGoddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?\r\nNed\r\nMmm, oh, it hurts, it hurts, mmm.\r\nCartman is now cooking his weenies over Ned\'s burning body.\r\nCartman\r\nHey you guys, this works pretty good right meah.\r\nCity Hall, The following morning.\r\nChef\r\nBut you see Mr. Mayor, you can\'t stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What\'s next, meatloaf?\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nWe are quite aware of your concerns Chef, but...\r\nThe intercom beeps. She answers.\r\nJohnson\r\nMayor, the geologist is here to see you.\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nMy geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don\'t need another check-up.\r\nJohnson\r\nNo mayor, that\'s a gynecologist. A geologist studies the earth.\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nDon\'t you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God\'s sake! You get out of my office!\r\nJohnson\r\nI\'m not in your office mayor, I\'m talking to you through a speaker.\r\nLong pause.\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nJust send in the geometrist.\r\nJohnson\r\nGeologist...\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nYou are fired, buddy!\r\nJohnson\r\nThank you mayor, it\'s been great working for you.\r\nRandy enters.\r\nRandy\r\nMayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt.\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nWhat does this mean to the town?\r\nRandy\r\nWell, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.\r\nHe points out relative damage levels on a chart.\r\nRandy\r\nRight now South Park is here.\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nMy God!\r\nChef\r\nMayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nOoh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there? [Beeps out.]\r\nTed\r\nUhh, you just fired Johnson, Mayor. I\'m his replacement, Ted.\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nTed, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh. [Thump.] Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don\'t worry, things are under control.\r\nBack on the Mountain. Jimbo is telling stories.\r\nJimbo\r\nAnd then... Ned picked up the grenade and... BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it\'s still crawling around to this day.\r\nNed extends his prosthetic arm towards Cartman as if to show that shot-off arm is now at the campsite, climbing on Cartman.\r\nNed\r\nMmmowwwh.\r\nCartman flinches, and the others laugh.\r\nJimbo\r\nHah, got ya.\r\nCartman\r\nHeh, tha-that\'s not scary.\r\nKyle\r\nYou were scared Cartman! you almost peed your pants!\r\nCartman\r\nShut up, I didn\'t pee in my pants!\r\nJimbo\r\nHey Ned, hand me that gin.\r\nNed opens up the icebox and tosses a bottle to him.\r\nJimbo\r\nYou boys want to tie one on?\r\nKyle\r\nNo, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.\r\nStan\r\nYeah, Cartman\'s pee.\r\nCartman\r\nHey, you would taste my pee!\r\nJimbo\r\nWhat the hell\'s wrong with you? Can\'t you have a little alcohol?\r\nKenny reaches for the gasoline can and chugs away.\r\nJimbo\r\nChrist, look at that little bastard go!\r\nKenny hiccups.\r\nJimbo\r\nNow you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!\r\nStan\r\nHey, I\'m a dirty little bastard too.\r\nCartman\r\nHey you guys. I know a scary story.\r\nKyle\r\nShut up, Cartman! You can\'t scare anybody!\r\nSoftly, slowly, flashlight ready.\r\nCartman\r\nOh yeah? You guys ever heard of [He turns his flashlight on his face for dramatic effect.] Scuzzlebutt?\r\nStan\r\nWhatabutt?\r\nCartman\r\nScuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.\r\nStan\r\nWhy?\r\nCartman\r\nBecause, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.\r\nKyle\r\nDeformed how?\r\nCartman\r\nWell, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has...\r\nStan\r\nA hook.\r\nKyle\r\nA knife.\r\nCartman\r\nNo! A piece of celery.\r\nStan\r\nCelery?\r\nCartman\r\nYeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there\'s nothing but...Patrick Duffy.\r\nKyle\r\nPatrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that\'s not scary!\r\nCartman\r\nWhat do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step? [Silence.] So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tashink ...tashink ...tashink.\r\nStan\r\nCartman, you suck at telling scary stories.\r\nKyle\r\nYeah, give me that flashlight.\r\nKyle takes it and turns it off.\r\nThe volcano rumbles again.\r\nKenny\r\n(Hey, what\'s that?)\r\nKyle\r\nWhat is that?\r\nStan\r\nMaybe it\'s Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.\r\nCartman\r\nHey, it might be!\r\nKyle\r\nGosh, I hope he doesn\'t cut me with his celery hand.\r\nThe others laugh.\r\nCartman\r\nScrew you guys! ...Go to Hell!\r\nJimbo is now playing his guitar.\r\nJimbo\r\nHey Ned, why don\'t you whip out the ol\' cancer kazoo? Let\'s do a little song.\r\nNed\r\nAbumbayah my lord, kumbayah.\r\nUumbayah my lord, kumbayah.\r\nUumbayah my lord, kumbayah.\r\n[Uncle Jimbo cries]\r\nMmmoh lord, Kumbayah.\r\nEmsomeone\'s crying my lord, Kumbayah\r\nSomeone\'s crying my lord, Kumbayah...\r\n\r\nCartman\r\nThey don\'t think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let\'s see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I\'ll scare the hell out of \'em tomorrow!\r\nNed\r\n...Someone\'s crying my lord, Kumbayah.\r\nMoh lord, Kumbayah.\r\n\r\nNext morning. A rooster crows.\r\nKyle\r\nStan, Stan, wake up!\r\nStan\r\nWhat, dude?\r\nKyle\r\nI don\'t know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.\r\nStan\r\nWhere\'s my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?\r\nKyle\r\nThey\'re out fishing with Kenny.\r\nStan\r\nWith Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn\'t he like me anymore?\r\nKyle\r\nWell Stan, you want to know what I think?\r\nStan\r\nWhat?\r\nKyle farts, and is pleased with himself. Stan does nothing.\r\nIn the fishing boat.\r\nJimbo\r\nWhat a beautiful morning for fishing. There\'s one, there\'s a fish right there!\r\nHe throws grenade, killing a fish.\r\nNed\r\nMmm, got it.\r\nKenny throws a grenade, killing four fish.\r\nJimbo\r\nGreat instincts boy.\r\nStan runs to the side of the lake.\r\nStan\r\nUncle Jimbo, Cartman\'s missing!\r\nJimbo\r\nWho? The fat kid?\r\nStan\r\nYeah.\r\nJimbo\r\nAh hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!\r\nNed fires the load and a massive amount of fish float to the surface. The boat lands a second later\r\nJimbo\r\nWell, I think that\'s about the limit for our fishing permit.\r\nNed\r\n[Rowing to shore.] Moh man it smells like dead fish here.\r\nKenny\r\n(A little like a vagina.)\r\nNed\r\nEm-moh man, that is nasty.\r\nJimbo\r\nHeh, I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I\'m making you... my honorary nephew.\r\nKenny\r\n(Thanks.)\r\nStan\'s head drops.\r\nIn front of city hall. The media is now present.\r\nNewscaster\r\nThe people of South Park are humble and friendly. But now, a ticking time-bomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony.\r\nCrowd\r\nYeahhh.\r\nThey sound more excited than agonized.\r\nIndividual in crowd\r\nHey, I\'m on TV! I\'m on TV!\r\nNewscaster\r\nMayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe?\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nAll we know right now is that some of our children [Sob-sob.] are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I\'m sorry, can I start over?\r\nNewscaster\r\nHuh?\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nWell you can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1 [Melodramatically.] All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can\'t do anything until we get them. Okay people, let\'s go get those kids.\r\nChef\r\nCome on everybody. You got to help the children.\r\nOn the mountain.\r\nJimbo\r\nUh, well, he couldn\'t have gone far, unless something drug him off.\r\nNed\r\nThere\'s not many animals out today, Jimbo, mmm.\r\nJimbo\r\nYeah, it\'s almost like something funny\'s going on.\r\nThe volcano rumbles.\r\nJimbo\r\nChrist, Ned, what\'d you have for breakfast.\r\nNed\r\nMm I don\'t know man. I\'ve got some bad gas.\r\nJimbo\r\nWait, there\'s a ram! It\'s coming right for us!\r\nFires at the ram. Kenny takes over.\r\nJimbo\r\nNice shootin\' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun.\r\nKyle\r\nLook!\r\nCartman\r\nI am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.\r\nNed\r\nMmm, what is it?\r\nKyle\r\nDude, it\'s Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn\'t lying.\r\nJimbo\r\nHoly crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.\r\nNed\r\nWe\'ll be on the cover of \"Guns & Ammo\".\r\nJimbo\r\nThis calls for some HJ-14.\r\nCartman\r\n[To himself.] Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.\r\nJimbo is now armed with twin shoulder rockets.\r\nJimbo\r\nFire in the hoooole!\r\nCartman\r\nHoly crap!\r\nCartman jumps out of the way. The rockets hit the mound and debris goes in all directions.\r\nJimbo\r\nDamn it, I think I missed.\r\nCartman\r\nWhat the hell is wrong with you people?!\r\nJimbo\r\nC\'mon, let\'s move, move!\r\nCartman sees them coming and backs away.\r\nCartman\r\nHey, wait, aah!\r\nRescue Center.\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nIs, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!\r\nRandy\r\nMayor, I might have an uhh, idea.\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nHuh, what?\r\nRandy\r\nWell if we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park pretty much completely.\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nAnd, that would be good? Right?\r\nRandy\r\nUh - pretty sure.\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nWell, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!\r\nOn the mountain. Jimbo and the others have lost sight of Cartman.\r\nJimbo\r\nThese look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I\'ll bet that sucker\'s headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!! [Shoots a bald eagle.] The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe.\r\nKyle\r\n[Sees Cartman still dressed as Scuzzlebutt] Look, up there.\r\nCartman\r\nYou guys, it\'s just me.\r\nJimbo\r\nAre we sure it\'s Scuzzlebutt?\r\nStan\r\nDoes it have Patrick Duffy for a leg?\r\nJimbo\r\nI can\'t tell; let\'s kill it!\r\nCartman\r\nEh, gotta get out of this stupid costume.\r\nJimbo\r\nKenny, you take the front.\r\nStan\r\nNo!\r\nStan takes the rifle from Kenny.\r\nStan\r\nI can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!\r\nJimbo\r\nThat\'s the spirit, kiddo. Let\'s hunt!\r\nCartman\r\nYou guys, you guys, I was just kidding!\r\nTownspeople digging trench.\r\nNewscaster\r\nAs some people of South Park try desperately to save their mountain town, others look for the missing townspeople. But all must take every precaution necessary.\r\nRescue Center.\r\nOfficer Barbrady\r\nOkay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please.\r\nMr. Garrison starts the film.\r\nHost\r\nHarbingers of sorrow, natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress, and the volcano is no exception. But what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family? Here we see the Stevens family enjoying a [Film skips] May picnic, but suddenly daughter hears a noise. It\'s a volcano. Junior seems worried. But have no fear Junior, Jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt.\r\nJane backs up, pulls out the blanket from under the food, and throws it over her family.\r\nHost\r\nThat\'s right Jane, duck and cover.\r\nShe ducks under the blanket herself. The lava rolls over the family, causing no harm. The blanket flies off, revealing a sparkling family.\r\nHost\r\nSo what will you [Film skips] -do when you hear a volcano erupting?\r\nTwo boys on bikes look alarmed. They leap off their bikes and hit the street, duck, and cover their heads with their arms.\r\nHost\r\nThat\'s right, duck and cover.\r\nThe lava rolls over the two, causing no harm.\r\nHost\r\nLooks like you got the idea. Duck and cover. Thank you and goodbye.\r\nOfficer Barbrady\r\nOK, any questions?\r\nChef\r\nThat has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!\r\nOfficer Barbrady\r\nThat\'s enough out of you!\r\nOn the mountain. Cartman moves further up on the slope and turns around.\r\nStan\r\nI\'m gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we\'ll see who\'s the little bastard.\r\nCartman\r\nHey, seriously you guys!\r\nKyle\r\n[Hushed.] Kill it, Stan. Kill it. [Normally.] Come on Stan, kill it.\r\nStan\r\nAh, damn it, I can\'t do it!\r\nJimbo swats Stan behind the head.\r\nJimbo\r\nYou pansy! give me that gun.\r\nCartman\r\nHey!\r\nStan\r\nCartman?\r\nCartman\r\nGoddammit, don\'t shoot me!\r\nJimbo\r\nWhat the Sam Hell?\r\nCartman\r\nI was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.\r\nNed\r\nMmm, so much for the cover of \"Guns & Ammo\".\r\nJimbo\r\nYepper, but I think we\'ve learned some important lessons Ned I think that-\r\nBoom! Lava begins to bubble out and flow.\r\nKyle\r\nWhoa!\r\nNed\r\nMmm, holy crap.\r\nJimbo\r\nThe mountain! It\'s blown it\'s top!\r\nA boulder of lava lands in front of Kenny.\r\nKyle\r\nOh my God, they killed Kenny!\r\nKenny steps out from behind the boulder.\r\nKenny\r\n(Nope, I\'m okay.)\r\nKenny sees his arm on fire.\r\nKenny\r\n(It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)\r\nThe boulder rolls onto Kenny.\r\nKenny\r\n(Ugh.)\r\nOn the side of the mountain.\r\nTownsman 1\r\nLook, the volcano.\r\nTownsman 2\r\nQuick, duck and cover.\r\nThey do. The lava sweeps them down the mountainside, burning them to the bone.\r\nAt the base of the mountain, Jimbo and the others are moving quickly.\r\nKyle, Stan, Cartman\r\nAaaaah!\r\nJimbo\r\nThat lava\'s coming right for us!!\r\nBehind them a river of lava charges down the mountain.\r\nLooking on from the edge of town.\r\nChef\r\nOh no, look.\r\nAt the trench. Jimbo and the others have made it out of the mountain, but their way into town has been cut off.\r\nJimbo\r\nWhat the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can\'t get across!\r\nNewscaster\r\nIt now looks as if the missing children are trapped in the path of hot, nasty lava.\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nGod, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-\r\nCartman\r\nHelp!\r\nScuzzlebutt appears and scratches his belly.\r\nJimbo\r\nJimminy Pope, it\'s the real Scuzzlebutt!\r\nCartman\r\nWhat?! Scuzzlebutt\'s real?!\r\nKyle\r\nOh my God! Look at his leg!\r\nPatrick Duffy\r\nHi kids, I\'m TV\'s Patrick Duffy.\r\nJimbo\r\nQuick Ned, shoot it!\r\nNed aims, but no shot is heard.\r\nNed\r\nMmmoh no, out of ammo.\r\nScuzzlebutt\r\nGrrrr.\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nWhat... is that thing?\r\nChef\r\nThat\'s Scuzzlebutt.\r\nMr. Garrison\r\nYeah, he has Patrick Duffy for a leg, and weaves baskets.\r\nOfficer Barbrady\r\nThis isn\'t happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.\r\nJimbo\r\nWell boys, I\'m sorry I got you all killed.\r\nScuzzlebutt rips a tree from the ground, bites off a limb...\r\nKyle\r\nAaaaah!\r\n...and molds the tree into a-\r\nStan\r\nWhoa, he built a wicker basket.\r\nJimbo\r\nHey, he\'s saving us.\r\nScuzzlebutt puts the group in the basket and lifts them over the trench.\r\nScuzzlebutt\r\nGrrr.\r\nLiane\r\nScuzzlebutt saved the day.\r\nRandy\r\nAnd my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nHmmm. Where exactly does the canyon go?\r\nRandy\r\nUhh...\r\nDenver citizens\r\nAaaaah.\r\nSouth Park. The ordeal is over.\r\nMr. Garrison\r\nSouth Park is saved.\r\nCheers go up.\r\nKyle\r\nHey look, Kenny\'s okay.\r\nKenny appears on a mound nearby.\r\nKenny\r\n(Hey guys, what\'s goin\' down?)\r\nNewscaster\r\nAnd now these humble people can rejoice and celebrate their jovial victory over nature. I\'m getting word that the chef of the school cafeteria wants to sing a song about this thrilling struggle of humanity.\r\nChef\r\nMmmm\r\nBaby every time that we kiss,\r\nHot Lava!\r\nEvery time that we make love, hot lava,\r\nHot Lava!\r\nLava so hot it makes me sweat,\r\nLava so warm and red and wet,\r\nLava!\r\nBrrrrrrrrrrrr.\r\n\r\nNewscaster\r\nMayor, what do you have to say about this wonderful outcome?\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nWell, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt.\r\nScuzzlebutt\r\nFriend.\r\nScuzzlebutt presents flowers to the Mayor.\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nOh, how sweet.\r\nStan shoots scuzzlebutt.\r\nStan\r\nI did it, I did it, I finally killed something.\r\nHe smiles, proud of himself. Unfortunately, this took place during a live report.\r\nNewscaster\r\nOh my God! What has he done?\r\nMayor McDaniels\r\nTurn off the cameras!\r\nStan\r\nHey, that was easy!\r\nPatrick Duffy\r\nNoooo! Why God? Why?!\r\nJimbo\r\nDamn it Stan, you shouldn\'t have done that!\r\nStan\r\nWhat?! Why?!\r\nKyle\r\nYeah, make up your mind, dude!\r\nJimbo\r\nStan, some things you kill, and some things you don\'t. See?\r\nStan\r\nNo.\r\nNed\r\nMoh, only now in this late hour do I see the folly of guns. Mmm, I\'ll never use a gun again, mmm.\r\nDrops his gun, which fires one last shot as it hits the snow. Kenny is hit.\r\nKenny\r\n(Oh, no!)\r\nRats are hot on the trail.\r\nStan\r\nBut I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.\r\nJimbo\r\nBut Kenny\'s dead now, Stan, and you\'re always going to be my nephew. And you can\'t just kill anything. You understand?\r\nKyle\r\nDude, I don\'t understand hunting at all.\r\nStan\r\nYeah, [He drops his gun.] it\'s stupid. Let\'s go watch cartoons.\r\nCartman\r\nYeah, cartoons kick ass! [All three leave.]']
